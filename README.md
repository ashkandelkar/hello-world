# hello-world
Hi everyone,
The name's Kandelkar...Ashutosh Kandelkar.
I'm a newly appointed intern at a really good establishment where everyone is better than me at what they do.
A little nervous and scared but inspired at the same time.
Inspired to be as good as they are. Better, even.
I like TV shows, Anime, Mangas, Sketching, and all kinds of Music.
Recently got into working out and so far I'm loving it.
Hope to enjoy life some day...
So long!
