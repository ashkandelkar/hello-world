# hello-world
Hi everyone,
The name's Kandelkar...Ashutosh Kandelkar
I'm a newly appointed intern at a really good establishment where everyone is better than me at what they do
A little nervous and scared bud inspi/.red at the same time
Inspired to be as good as they are. Better, even
I like TV shows, Anime, Mangas, Sketching, and all kinds of Music
Recently got into working out and so far I'm loving it
Hope to enjoy life some day
So long!
